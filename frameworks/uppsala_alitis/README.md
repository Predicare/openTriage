# uppsala_alitis

This framework implements models based on Emergency Medical Dispatch system data from the Alitis platform using the methodology described in [this research paper](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0226518). This is the modelling framework which we use at our dispatch center here in Uppsala.

If adapting these methods in your own research, please cite our paper:
